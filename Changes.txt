Any changes made to the previous deliverables have been noted with bold, italicized text in the documentation. A short summary of all changes made are below: 

*The QuizResult interface was implemented more completely; functions perform described functions instead of simply being stubs. 
*Sample data was provided using the QuizAttempt class; this is a sample class used to emulate the data format that would be received from Persist, based on the TakeQuiz module. 
*Unit tests were modified to properly utilize the functions, as opposed to simply using the stubs as previously. 
* Points 12-14 were added in the grading criteria of the readme file. 
*The UML diagram was updated to demonstrate proper decoupling from the other modules.
*The ReadMe was updated to reflect the changes made.
*The original A5 deliverables were zipped and included for reference.
